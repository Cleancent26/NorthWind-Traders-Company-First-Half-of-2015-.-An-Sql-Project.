##### Northwind Traders, a company known for distributing gourmet food products, wants to make its operations better and decisions smarter in the 2nd half of 2015. To achieve this, the company plans to study its sales data, how customers behave, and how well its products are doing with emphasis on the 1st half of 2015. By doing this, Northwind Traders hopes to find important insights and ways to grow even more.
##### In their analysis, Northwind Traders wants to look closely at sales trends, how customers buy things, and which products are selling well based on what was achieved in the 1st half of 2015. They believe that by understanding these things better, they can make smarter choices about what to sell and how to sell it. This means they can make sure they have the right products in stock and keep their customers happy.
